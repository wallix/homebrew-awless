  def caveats
    <<~EOS

      In order to get awless completion,
        [bash] you need to install `bash-completion` with brew.
        OR
        [zsh], add the following line to your ~/.zshrc:
          source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions/_awless
    EOS
  end

  test do
    run_output = shell_output("#{bin}/awless --help 2>&1")
    assert_match "Awless is a powerful command line tool to inspect, sync and manage your infrastructure", run_output
  end
